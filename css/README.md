# HTML & CSS3 Course

If you are not familiar with linters and Stickler, read [root level README](../README.md).

Please do the following **steps in this order**:

1. Install stickler-ci https://github.com/apps/stickler-ci
2. Enable stickler in your repo.
3. In first commit of your feature branch add a copy of [.stickler.yml](./.stickler.yml).
    - **Remember** to use the copy linked above
    - **Remember** that file names starts with a dot
4. When you open your first pull request you should see Stickler's report at `Checks` tab.


## Troubleshooting

1. `while scanning for the next token found character '\t' that cannot start any token` error.
Please make sure that you used spaces not tabs for indentation.
