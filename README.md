# Linters Config

## How to use this repo? 🤔

Each directory listed below contains config files specific to one programming language and README file with detailed instructions:

- [html&css](./html-css)
- [ruby](./ruby)
- [ror](./ror)
- [javascript](./javascript)
- [react&redux](./react-redux)

Follow those instructions in order to set up linters or validators in your repo.

In order to get to know more about linters and GitHub Actions read the recap below.

## Linters

A linter is a tool that analyzes your source code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs(source: [Wikipedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)>)).

There are a few reasons for using linters:

1. Catching syntax errors is more efficient. There is no need to debug simple mistakes like typos - the linter does it for you.
2. The entire codebase looks like written by one person.
3. Programmers can focus on solving problems, instead of cleaning up the code.

---

You can find linters for most of the programming languages, e.g. Rubocop for Ruby or ESLint for JavaScript.

Also, there are many ways you can integrate a linter in your workflow:

- text editor plugin
- GitHub Actions
- GitHub apps

## GitHub Actions

[Github Actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions) is a [CI/CD](https://codilime.com/what-is-ci-cd-all-you-need-to-know/) service offered by GitHub. It allows you to automate your workflow by letting GitHub take care of a number of tasks which can be triggered by [different of events](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows) on the platform.

🐛 **What to do if GitHub Actions does not work?** Check [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) below.

You can automate tasks by creating **workflows** in your GitHub repository. GitHub will look for [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) files inside of the `.github/workflows` directory.

## Troubleshooting

Depending on the configuration of your GitHub credentials, you may have an error like this when trying to create a new GitHub Actions workflow:

```
! [remote rejected] master -> master (refusing to allow an OAuth App to create or update workflow `.github/workflows/file.yml` without `workflow` scope)

```

The problem is that you may be using a credentials app like [Credential Manager in Windows](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/issues/4916#issuecomment-557509451) or OSX Keychain. In that case, you should [setup a personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) and configure it in your credentials app. Make sure to check the `workflow` permissions whne you setup your personal access token.

If you had a different problem related to a specific tool, please check detailed instructions for each linter:

- [html&css](./html-css#troubleshooting)
- [ruby](./ruby#troubleshooting)
- [ror](./ror#troubleshooting)
- [javascript](./javascript#troubleshooting)
- [react&redux](./react-redux#troubleshooting)

## Validation

Do not make any changes in config files - they represent style guidelines that you share with your team - which is a group of all Microverse students.

TSEs will validate that you are using the same configuration files provided here. You can check if your linter configuration is correct using the [`check-linters-config`](scripts) script.

## Stickler

This is the **GitHub Actions configuration**. If you are looking for the **Stickler configuration**, you can find it [here](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config/tree/Stickler).
