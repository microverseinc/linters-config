    - Try to add a new commit to your Pull Request. Stickler should detect changes in your repo and start checking your code.
2. `while scanning for the next token found character '\t' that cannot start any token` error.
    - Please make sure that you used spaces not tabs for indentation.
3. Check if someone else has had similar problem before [here](https://questions.microverse.org/c/linters-stickler).
    Please make sure that you used spaces not tabs for indentation.
4. Stickler does not work and nothing helps ðŸ’¥ - run `eslint` in your local env: 
    - run `npx eslint --init` [Follow that Install eslint instruction :point_up:] (not sure how to use npm? Read [this](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm))
    - run `npx eslint .`
    - fix linter errors
    - **Remember to let your Code Reviewer know that you had problems with Stickler and you used linter in local env.**
