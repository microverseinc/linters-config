# Javascript & React & Redux Course


If you are not familiar with linters and Stickler, read [root level README](../README.md).

Please do the following **steps in this order**:

1. Install eslint
   1. run `npx eslint --init`
   2. How would you like to use ESLint? Select `To check syntax, find problems, and enforce code style`
   3. What type of modules does your project use? Select `Javascript module(import/export)` { if your project has babel installed then you definitely need to choose this option. If you are working on a project such as React, Vue, Angular e.t.c they all use babel so you need choose this option.} or `CommonJS (require/exports)` {this option is meant for commonJS that has nothing to do with babel, maybe your nodejs project and any other javascript project} 
   4. Which framework does your project use? Select `None of this` (if that project is non-react project) or `React` (if that is a react-redux project)
   5. Where does your code run? Select `Browser` (If that app is a web based app or front-end) or `Node` (if that app is console based or back end)
   6. How would you like to define a style for your project? Select `Use a popular style guide`
   7. Which style guide do you want to follow? Select `Airbnb`
   8. What format do you want your config file to be in? Select `JavaScript`
   9.  Would you like to install them now with npm? Select `Y` to install all the necessary packages for eslint.
   10. After that it generate a `.eslintrc.js` file and with that we successfully installed eslint
   
   [**Note:** [Here](https://dev.to/iamdammak/setting-up-eslint-in-your-javascript-project-with-vs-code-2amf) is a nice article about how to use eslint and setup in a project]

2. Install stickler-ci https://github.com/apps/stickler-ci
3. Enable stickler in your repo. You can do it [here](https://stickler-ci.com/).
4. In first commit of your feature branch add a copy of [.stickler.yml](./.stickler.yml)
    - **Remember** to use file linked above
    - **Remember** that `.stickler.yml` file name starts with a dot
5. When you open your first pull request you should see Stickler's report at `Checks` tab.




## Troubleshooting

1. All config files are in my repo bu Stickler does not work.
    - Make sure that Stickler app has permission to access your repository. Find Stickler here https://github.com/settings/installations and check its configuration.

    - Try to add a new commit to your Pull Request. Stickler should detect changes in your repo and start checking your code.
2. `while scanning for the next token found character '\t' that cannot start any token` error.
    - Please make sure that you used spaces not tabs for indentation.
3. Check if someone else has had similar problem before [here](https://questions.microverse.org/c/linters-stickler).
    Please make sure that you used spaces not tabs for indentation.
4. Stickler does not work and nothing helps ðŸ’¥ - run `eslint` in your local env: 
    - run `npx eslint --init` [Follow that Install eslint instruction :point_up:] (not sure how to use npm? Read [this](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm))
    - run `npx eslint .`
    - fix linter errors
    - **Remember to let your Code Reviewer know that you had problems with Stickler and you used linter in local env.**
